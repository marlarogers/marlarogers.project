            <p>Hi! My name is Marla. I was born in San Diego, CA in 1990. I have lived in Pennsylvania, Massachussetts, and France. Fun fact about me, I hate writing bios! So the rest of this will be about my cat.
                <br>I found my cat Dany on the side of the road when she was just a kitten. I was driving near my parents' house out in the countryside and saw her dart into a bush. She was scared to come out at first, but when she finally did I picked her up and she started purring.
                <br>She is an amazing cat. She has driven cross country with me twice, she LOVES people and is super social, and prefers playing with my hair ties to her actual cat toys. 
                <br>Whenever we have guests over, she rolls around in the middle of the room to get everyone to pay attention to her (she's so flirty!) and get jealous when we all talk amongst ourselves and ignore her.
